# Cross-Sensor Change Detection Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a fully automated, reproducible workflow for detecting seasonal surface water changes using Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery.  
The analysis focuses on two hydrologically dynamic regions in Odisha, India:

- **Hirakud Reservoir** – a large dam with significant seasonal water level variation  
- **Chilika Lake** – India’s largest coastal lagoon, influenced by monsoon and tidal dynamics  

## Workflow Highlights

- Automated data acquisition via ASF and AWS STAC APIs  
- Preprocessing (SAR filtering, NDWI computation, cloud masking)  
- Coregistration of SAR and optical data  
- Change detection and visual interpretation
